    "title": "Our story",
    "subtitle": "Reinventing exploration and memory creation",
    "paragraph1": "Magellan was born from a simple idea: to transform every journey into a richer, smoother, and more memorable experience. Our belief? Travel is not just about moving from place to place. It's a moment of emotion, discovery, connection. An adventure that deserves to be understood—and shared—differently.",
    "paragraph2": "Thanks to generative artificial intelligence, Magellan becomes the essential tool for modern travelers: an app capable of enriching every stage of the journey, effortlessly organizing memories, and automatically telling living, authentic, and personalized stories.",
    "paragraph3": "Our core value: making every journey an enriched cultural exploration, while simplifying the creation of captivating and shareable memories.",
    "genesis": {
      "title": "The genesis: the day it all began",
      "paragraph1": "It all started with a trip to Morocco. With a friend, we wandered through villages, medinas, alleys steeped in history... but paradoxically, we found no clear information about the places we were visiting.",
      "paragraph2": "So a question arose: what if a simple photo could tell us the story of the world around us?",
      "paragraph3": "What if, by capturing a monument, a scene of life, or a landscape, AI could instantly offer us its precise description, its little-known anecdotes, its historical context, nearby recommendations, and even ideas to enrich our travel journal?",
      "paragraph4": "This idea—born on a bustling square in Marrakech—became the cornerstone of Magellan. Since that day, our ambition has remained the same: to give every traveler the power to explore, understand, and share the world like never before."
